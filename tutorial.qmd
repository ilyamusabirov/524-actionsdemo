## The Monday Morning Commute

It is 8:00 AM on a Monday in November. You look out the window of your Kitsilano apartment. It's grey. It's wet.

You need to walk 15 minutes to the bus stop and wait for the R4. The weather app says it's 6°C with 25 km/h winds.

**Will you freeze?** Using the `vancouver_survival` package, we can calculate strictly scientific metrics to decide your fate.

### Calculating the Warmth Score

Let's define the parameters of your misery.

```{python}
from vancouver_survival.clothing import calculate_warmth_score, suggest_rain_gear

# Weather Conditions
temp_c = 6.0
wind_kmh = 25.0
is_raining = True

# The "Standing Still" Factor
waiting_for_bus = True 

score = calculate_warmth_score(temp_c, wind_kmh, waiting_for_bus)

print(f"Your Survival Score is: {score}")
```

*Note: A higher score indicates a higher likelihood of regretting your life choices.*

### Selecting Gear

The wind is picking up. Do you risk the umbrella, or will it turn inside out immediately?

```{python}
# 90% chance of rain, 25km/h wind
gear = suggest_rain_gear(precip_probability=90, wind_speed_kmh=wind_kmh)

print(f"Recommended Strategy: {gear}")
```

Follow this advice, and you might just make it to campus dry.
