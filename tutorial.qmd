## The Monday Morning Commute

It is 8:00 AM on a Monday in November. You look out the window of your Kitsilano apartment. It's grey. It's wet.

You need to walk 15 minutes to the bus stop and wait for the R4. The weather app says it's 6°C with 25 km/h winds.

**Will you freeze?** Using the `vancouver_survival` package, we can calculate strictly scientific metrics to decide your fate.

### Calculating the Warmth Score

Let's define the parameters of your misery.

```{python}
from vancouver_survival.clothing import calculate_warmth_score, suggest_rain_gear

# Weather Conditions
temp_c = 6.0
wind_kmh = 25.0
is_raining = True

# The "Standing Still" Factor
waiting_for_bus = True 

score = calculate_warmth_score(temp_c, wind_kmh, waiting_for_bus)

print(f"Your Survival Score is: {score}")
```

*Note: A higher score indicates a higher likelihood of regretting your life choices.*

### Selecting Gear

The wind is picking up. Do you risk the umbrella, or will it turn inside out immediately?

```{python}
# 90% chance of rain, 25km/h wind
gear = suggest_rain_gear(precip_probability=90, wind_speed_kmh=wind_kmh)

print(f"Recommended Strategy: {gear}")
```

Follow this advice, and you might just make it to campus dry.

### Forget Your Worries, Not Your Rain Gear

Lucy was running to catch the 99 B-Line but stopped dead in her tracks when she saw the skies turn into a pre-apocalypse grey. She peeked at her umbrella helplessly but noticed the gale winds bending a nearby tree. "Should I just wear my jacket, or brave it with the umbrella?" If only Lucy had this function to make the ultimate decision in the eternal umbrella vs. jacket debate.

```python
from vancouver_survival.clothing import suggest_rain_gear

# Probability of rain: 80%, Winds: 40 km/h
decision = suggest_rain_gear(precip_probability=80, wind_speed_kmh=40)
print(decision)  # Output: "Waterproof Jacket"
```

### Coffee or Cocoa? A Commuter's Dilemma

It's 6:30 AM, and Sam is trying to decide between a hot coffee, iced coffee, or maybe a comforting hot chocolate before heading into the damp Vancouver morning. The chill outside is getting to him, but he's also got a long commute ahead. Good thing he remembered this trusty function before making a suboptimal caffeine-related life choice!

```python
from vancouver_survival.sustenance import recommend_beverage
from vancouver_survival.clothing import calculate_warmth_score

# Determine your warmth score first
warmth_score = calculate_warmth_score(temp_celsius=2, wind_speed_kmh=20, is_waiting_for_bus=True)

# Choose your beverage wisely
beverage = recommend_beverage(warmth_score)
print(beverage)  # Output: "Hot Coffee"
```
