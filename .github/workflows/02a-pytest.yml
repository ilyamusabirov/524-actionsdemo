# Example 2a: Simple CI Pipeline
# Demonstrates a typical Python CI workflow: setting up an environment,
# installing dependencies, and running tests (pytest) with coverage.

# Name of the workflow
name: 02a-pytest

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for 
  # the main branch
  #push:
  #  branches: [ main ]
  #pull_request:
  #  branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run 
# sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as 
    # part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository so your job can access it
      - name: Check-out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Set up Python
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.13'

      # Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -e ".[tests]"

      # Run pytest with coverage
      - name: Run tests with coverage
        run: |
          pytest --cov --cov-report=term --cov-branch
