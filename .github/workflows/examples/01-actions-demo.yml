# Example 1: Basic Workflow
# Demonstrates the fundamental structure of a GitHub Action: triggers (on),
# jobs, steps, runners (runs-on), and executing simple shell commands.

name: 01demo
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  #push:
  #  branches: [ main ]
  #  # paths filters allow you to run workflows only when specific files change:
  #  # paths:
  #  #   - 'src/**'
  #  #   - '**.py'
  #  # paths-ignore:
  #  #   - 'docs/**' 
  #  #   - 'README.md'
  #  # tags filters allow you to run workflows only when tagged commits are pushed:
  #  # tags:
  #  #   - 'v1.*'             # Push events to matching v1.0, v1.1, and v1.9 tags

  #pull_request:
  #  branches: [ main ]
  #  # paths:
  #  #   - 'src/**'

  # schedule allows you to run workflows at specific times (UTC):
  # schedule:
  #   - cron: '30 5 * * 1,3' # Runs at 05:30 on Mon and Wed UTC

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
